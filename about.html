                    Hi, I'm Nick
                </h1>
                <p>
                  I'm a content designer and technical writer living in the beautiful Pacific Northwest where I can enjoy the ideal combination of tech, coffee, and the outdoors.                </p>
                <p>
                  Before I got started in technical communications, I was a consumer of documentation as a computer repair technician. When I moved into web development, good docs were again pivotal to my success.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, I didn't start understanding good technical communication until I began a career in retail operations and management.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In these roles I found myself thrust into a world of undocumented processes, tribal knowledge, and an aversion to new technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My IT experience taught me the value of good documentation, and as a manager, I wanted to have something my new hires could use as a reference for my department's operations and technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I had of course written docs before as a developer, but it wasn't until my roles in retail sales that I learned to write with empathy. I had always been good at defining a problem, but what really helped me excel is learning about design thinking and implementing that into my work as a writer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now my work spans many spheres ranging from API documentation to information architecture and content strategy. But no matter what I'm writing, I always start with who I'm writing for and I believe that is the key to good documentation and a great user experience.            
                </p>
